**NgRx Plugin for Generating Actions and Reducer Based on the Handler Map**

## ‚òùÔ∏è Why to use NgRx Handlers?

- Because it's boring to write action types manually
- Because you don't need to write too much code for simple functionality
- Because unlike other similar plugins, NgRx Handlers keep NgRx look and feel

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Installation

NPM: `npm install ngrx-handlers`

Yarn: `yarn add ngrx-handlers`

### ‚ö° Usage

**NgRx Actions and Reducer**

```typescript
// books-page.actions.ts
export const enter = createAction('[Books Page] Enter');
export const updateSearchTerm = createAction(
  '[Books Page] Update Search Term',
  props<{ searchTerm: string }>(),
);
export const updateSelectedBookId = createAction(
  '[Books Page] Update Selected Book Id',
  props<{ selectedBookId: number }>(),
);

// books-effects.actions.ts
export const fetchBooks = createAction('[Books Effects] Fetch Books');
export const fetchBooksSuccess = createAction(
  '[Books Effects] Fetch Books Success',
  props<{ books: Book[] }>(),
);
export const fetchBooksError = createAction('[Books Effects] Fetch Books Error');

// books.reducer.ts
import * as BooksPageActions from './actions/books-page.actions';
import * as BooksEffectsActions from './actions/books-effects.actions';

export const reducer = createReducer(
  initBooksState,
  on(BooksPageActions.enter, state => ({ ...state, searchTerm: '' })),
  on(BooksPageActions.updateSearchTerm, (state, { searchTerm }) => ({ ...state, searchTerm })),
  on(BooksPageActions.updateSelectedBookId, (state, { selectedBookId }) => ({
    ...state,
    selectedBookId,
  })),
  on(BooksEffectsActions.fetchBooks, state => ({ ...state, loading: true })),
  on(BooksEffectsActions.fetchBooksSuccess, (state, { books }) => ({
    ...state,
    books,
    loading: false,
  })),
  on(BooksEffectsActions.fetchBooksError, state => ({ ...state, books: [], loading: false })),
);
```

**NgRx Handlers**

```typescript
// books-page.handlers.ts
export const [BooksPageActions, booksPageReducer] = combineHandlers(initBooksState, 'booksPage', {
  enter: state => ({ ...state, searchTerm: '' }),
  updateSearchTerm: (state, { searchTerm }: { searchTerm: string }) => ({ ...state, searchTerm }),
  updateSelectedBookId: (state, { selectedBookId }: { selectedBookId: number }) => ({
    ...state,
    selectedBookId,
  }),
});

// books-effects.handlers.ts
export const [BooksEffectsActions, booksEffectsReducer] = combineHandlers(
  initBooksState,
  'booksEffects',
  {
    fetchBooks: state => ({ ...state, loading: true }),
    fetchBooksSuccess: (state, { books }: { books: Book[] }) => ({
      ...state,
      books,
      loading: false,
    }),
    fetchBooksError: state => ({ ...state, books: [], loading: false }),
  },
);

// books.reducer.ts
export const booksReducer = mergeReducers(booksPageReducer, booksEffectsReducer);
```

`combineHandlers` function returns strongly typed action creators and a reducer with O(1) efficiency.

Another great thing about `combineHandlers` is that you don't have to manually write action types.
For example, when the source is `booksPage` and the event is `updateSearchTerm`, it will generate
the action creator with type `[booksPage] updateSearchTerm`.

Every reducer generated by `combineHandlers` function can be used independently via `StoreModule`.
However, if you have multiple sources for a single state slice, there is `mergeReducers` function that
will merge provided reducers into one.

In case you need to define actions without changing the state, this plugin provides `plain` and
`withPayload` functions.

```typescript
export const [BooksPageActions, booksPageReducer] = combineHandlers(initBooksState, 'booksPage', {
  showCreateBookDialog: plain(),
  createBook: withPayload<{ book: Book }>(),
});
```
